a breakdown of the JavaScript code focusing on the responses object and the functions:

const responses:

This object contains predefined responses based on user input.
Example responses include greetings, links, and generic responses.
The default key is used when the user input does not match any predefined response.
toggleChatbot():

This function toggles the display of the chatbot popup by changing its style from "none" to "block" and vice versa.
sendMessage():

This function retrieves the user input, appends it to the chatbox as a user message, and then calls respondToUser() to generate a response.
respondToUser(userInput):

This function retrieves the response based on the user input from the responses object.
It then appends the bot's response to the chatbox after a delay of 500ms.
appendMessage(sender, message):

This function appends a message to the chatbox based on the sender (user or bot).
It creates a new message element, assigns the appropriate CSS class, sets the message content, and appends it to the chatbox.
If the sender is the bot and the message is the default response, it adds "Yes" and "No" buttons for further interaction.
These functions together create a simple chatbot interface that responds to user input with predefined messages and provides options for further interaction.
